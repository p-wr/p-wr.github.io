Theorem noether_max P :
  (forall a b, (forall a' b', max a' b' < max a b -> P a' b') -> P a b) ->
  forall a b, P a b.
(* I have a truly remarkable proof of this theorem which this file  *
 * is too small to contain.                                         *)
Admitted.

Theorem case_split_3way P : forall a b,
    (a < b -> P a b) -> (a = b -> P a b) -> (a > b -> P a b) -> P a b.
Proof.
  intros. destruct (lt_eq_lt_dec a b) as [[Hlt|Heq]|Hgt]; firstorder.
Qed.

  Theorem euclid_terminates : forall a b, a > 0 -> b > 0 -> exists z, euclid a b z.
  Proof.
    intros a b. apply noether_max with (a:=a) (b:=b).
    clear a b.
    intros a b IH apos bpos.
    apply case_split_3way with (a:=a) (b:=b); intro H.
    - induction IH with (a':=a) (b':=b-a).     (* a < b *)
      * exists x. apply step_b'. assumption. assumption.
      * apply max_decreases. firstorder.
